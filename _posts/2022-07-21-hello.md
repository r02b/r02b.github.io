I have a <b>LOT</b> of code snippets of things I've learned through the past few years laying around, but I never seem to get to actually committing these to a proper repo. Some may seem redundant, but hey, I couldn't find them easily online, so why not <a href="https://twitter.com/NogaRot/status/1488957048079454210" target="_blank">document them</a> in some way.
Ergo, this blog. Hopefully it can help some folks out there.
