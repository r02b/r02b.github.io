Since starting grad school, I have been trying to raise awareness and promote knowledge exchange when it comes to skills and attributes required beyond those one might expect to have and demonstrate as a young researcher. 
One of these is having an online presence. I have had discussions with many grad school students on this topic, and by now I have heard all the excuses, starting from "I haven't published yet, so what's the point?", through "I barely have any publications, it'd just look weird", and finally, "well I honestly don't know how to do it and would rather do research instead.".

And so, as a PhD parting gift, I have created a [github repository](https://github.com/r02b/academic-website-template){:target="_blank"} for a very simple researcher homepage template.

<img class="image-right" alt="Homepage template" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/academic-homepage/main-page.jpg" /> 

The repository also includes a template for a project page:
<img class="image-right" alt="Project page template" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/academic-homepage/project-page.jpg" /> 

The goal is having a <b>free</b>, extremely simple template, that can be easily modified to suit basic needs - see the [README file](https://github.com/r02b/academic-website-template/blob/main/README.md){:target="_blank"} for a list of very basic adjustments available.
I might add a few enhancements and styles as time goes by, but I think the current content makes a good starting point.

[Enjoy](https://github.com/r02b/academic-website-template){:target="_blank"}!
